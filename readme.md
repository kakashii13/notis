### NOTIS SERVER

Before running the server, you need to set up a `.env` file in the project's root directory. This file should contain the following environment variables:

```env
 MONGO_URL="your mongodb url"
 JWT_PRIVATE_KEY="your jwt private key"
```

To start the server, run the following command:

```
npm run start:dev
```
